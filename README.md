# Machine-Learning
This is a machine learning assignment from my data science class at Harvard T.H. Chan with Dr. Heather Mattier (used with instructor permission). This code includes some data cleaning and visualization, with a greater focus on decision trees, random forests, and accuracy of criminal justice risk assessment scores.

Within this repository you can find the two csv files used in the program. To run the code, download the files, and move to your directory do download them into R.
